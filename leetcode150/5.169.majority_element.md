# 169. Majority Element

**Status:** Solved  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Array, Hash Table, Divide and Conquer, Sorting, Counting

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```text
nums = [3,2,3]
```

**Output:**

```text
3
```

### Example 2

**Input:**

```text
nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
```

**Output:**

```text
2
```

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- The input is generated such that a majority element will exist in the array.

## Follow-up

Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
