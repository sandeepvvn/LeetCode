### 151. Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space. Leading/trailing spaces and multiple spaces between words should be reduced to a single space in the result.

### Examples

- **Example 1**  
  - **Input**: `s = "the sky is blue"`  
  - **Output**: `"blue is sky the"`

- **Example 2**  
  - **Input**: `s = "  hello world  "`  
  - **Output**: `"world hello"`  
  - **Explanation**: The reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

- **Example 3**  
  - **Input**: `s = "a good   example"`  
  - **Output**: `"example good a"`  
  - **Explanation**: Multiple spaces between words are reduced to a single space.

### Constraints

- \(1 \leq s.\text{length} \leq 10^4\)
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is at least one word in `s`.

### Follow-up

If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with \(O(1)\) extra space?
